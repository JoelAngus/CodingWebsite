How to request and recieve data:
    First start both programs, one on the server and the other as a python file.
    To start the server, type "npm start" in the terminal.
    To start the test.py, type python test.py in the terminal.

    Now the test.py is now requesting data every 5 seconds. 
    To send data, go to the website and navigate to "My Posts" then "Post a New Post". Fill in all requirements.

    One completed, the data will be sent over to the python file as a json and it will be read and printed out.
    In future programs, we will work with this data instead of printing it out.
